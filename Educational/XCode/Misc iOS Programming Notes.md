Misc iOS Programming Notes
==========================

@class AVCaptureSession
-----------------------
Coordinates flow of data from AV input devices to outputs.

1. `alloc init` it
2. Add `AVCaptureDeviceInput`(s)
3. Add output(s), e.g. `AVCapture(StillImage|MovieFile)Output`
4. Invoke `startRunning` to start flow of data from inputs to outputs
5. Invoke `stopRunning` to stop the flow (I have it in `viewDidDisappear`)

viewWillAppear: vs. viewDidLoad
-------------------------------

#### See [diagram](#lifecycle_diagram)

* **`viewDidLoad`**
    * When a view has finished loading for the first time,
      immediately after the `init` method
    * Before the view is drawn on screen
        * Don't do calculations of geometry and visuals of the view
    * Calculations you have to do only once
        * E.g. set `UILabel` texts

* **`viewWillAppear** â€” called every time the view appears
    * Reset where in the `scrollView` the user is looking at every time the view appears
    * Don't put code that takes a lot of main-thread usage in here
    * Called again whenever ___ is displayed and removed
        * Alert View / Actionsheet
        * UIActivityController
        * Popover / Modal View


[Key-Value Coding](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html)
------------------

`NSKeyValueCoding` is an *informal protocol*, allowing Apps to access `properties` of an
`object` inderictly by *name* ('key'), rather than directly through an accessor method.


[Key-Value Observing](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html)
---------------------

* A mechanism that allows objects to be notified of changes to specific properties
  of other objects
* Particularly useful for communication between model and controller layers of the App
    * The controller would observe properties of model objects
    * Therefore view observes model through controller
    * Also, one model might observe another model, or even itself
