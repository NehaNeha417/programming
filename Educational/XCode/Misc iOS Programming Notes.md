viewWillAppear: vs. viewDidLoad
-------------------------------

#### See [diagram](#lifecycle_diagram)

* **`viewDidLoad`**
    * When a view has finished loading for the first time,
      immediately after the `init` method
    * Before the view is drawn on screen
        * Don't do calculations of geometry and visuals of the view
    * Calculations you have to do only once
        * E.g. set `UILabel` texts

* **`viewWillAppear** â€” called every time the view appears
    * Reset where in the `scrollView` the user is looking at every time the view appears
    * Don't put code that takes a lot of main-thread usage in here
    * Called again whenever ___ is displayed and removed
        * Alert View / Actionsheet
        * UIActivityController
        * Popover / Modal View
