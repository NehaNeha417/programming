- makes it an instance method
+ makes it a class method
± in the ().h makes it public

lazy instantiation can't use the ternary operator

if we `#import "subclass.h"`, we get everything for the superclass

if you implement both the setter AND getter
    you have to `@synthesise var = _var;`
    in `@implementation TheClass`
    
to make private @properties
    in the Class.m file, below #import, above @implementation
    put
        @interface ClassName()
        @property (nonatomic, etc.) Classname varname;
        ...
        @end

property non-pointer variables are 
    readwrite (by default)
    readonly (getter, no setter)
    
property pointer variables are
    strong (count this reference too)
    weak (ignore this reference when counting)
    
NSUInteger 
    is not an Object that requires a pointer
    is a typedef uint(32 for iPhone<5, 64 for iPhone≥5)
    
there are no type-parameters for collections

nil is "null-instance"
Nil is "Null-Class"
