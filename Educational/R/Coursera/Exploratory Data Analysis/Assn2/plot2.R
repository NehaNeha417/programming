## The Question

# 2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City,
#    Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?
#
#    Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

plot2 <- function() {
    # filter data to only Baltimore City, Maryland, then do something
    # similar to plot1
    
    # note: must stick to the BASE plotting system
}
