## The Question

# 4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal
#    combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

plot4 <- function() {
    # grep the SCC for the word coal in the short.name
    # use the associated SCCs to filter the NEI
    # plot that data by year similarly to the rest
}
