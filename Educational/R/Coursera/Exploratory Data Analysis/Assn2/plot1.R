## The Question

# 1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States
#    from 1999 to 2008?
#
#    Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total
#    PM_2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999,
#    2002, 2005, and 2008.

# scatterplot of summed output for each year for which we have data
plot1 <- function() {
    # the year is a factor variable, so it should be just a line
    # or two to sum it up
    
    # then I can just feed that into the base plotter
    
    # note: I must stick to the BASE plotting system    
}
