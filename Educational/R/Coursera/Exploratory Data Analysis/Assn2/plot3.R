## The Question

# 3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint,
#    onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen
#    decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City?
#
#    Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
#
#    Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

plot3 <- function() {
    # use the filtered data from plot2
    # separate it by source (factor variable)
    # plot that with ggplot2
    
    # note: use GGPLOT2 to make the plot
}
