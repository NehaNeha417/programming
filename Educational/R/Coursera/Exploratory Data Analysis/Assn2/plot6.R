## The Question

# 6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with
#    emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California
#    (fips == "06037").
#
#    Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

plot6 <- function() {
    # do the same as plot2 for LA County
    # plot them both on the same plot
    # add a label showing the different differences over time between the cities
}
