**Removes a property from an object**
#### 4/15/14

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete)

Does not directly free memory

* There is a mark-and-sweep **garbage collector**, one of whose advantages over
  ARC is that cycles are still collectable because they are unreachable from
  roots in the stack.

Examples:

    delete object.property
    delete object['property']

    var y = 23;
    delete y; // returns false because we can't delete variable names

    var x = 24;
    delete x; // returns true because we can delete properties of the global object

Deleting inherited properties has no effect, though returns `true`

**By default, `this` refers to the object that invokes the function where `this` is used.** Though see below for how to change this behavior using the `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` methods.

(When the code is executing in the browser...) **All global variables and functions are defined on the `window` object**. Therefore, `this` in a global function refers to the global `window` object (not in `strict` mode though).

bind(), call(), apply()
-----------------------

#### 4/14/14

* [Nice Tutorial](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-apply-call-and-bind-methods-are-essential-for-javascript-professionals/)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)

Recall that **functions** are **objects**, and **objects** have **prototypes**, and **prototypes** provide **methods**. So the methods `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` belong to `Function.prototype`.

**Allows you to easily set which specific object will be bound to *`this`* when a function or method is invoked.** 

The problem is that when we use the `this` keyword in methods, and we
call said methods from a receiver object, sometimes this is not bound
to the object that we intended. Said again, when we execute an object's
method from within another object, the `this` keyword now refers to calling
object, *not* the object where `this` was originally defined. This will
cause errors, and requires us to use one of the methods in this ยง to
specifically set the value of `this`.

### .apply()

    instance.method.apply(object2, array)
    
Call the `method()` method of `instance`, such that `this` (when used *inside*
`method()`) refers to `object2`. We are passing `array` to `method()` as parameters.
Now, if `method()` assigns any new attributes to `this`, they will
become attributes of `object2`.

#### Borrowing Array methods

`Arrays` come with a number of useful methods for iterating and modifying arrays,
`Objects` don't have useful native methods. If we have an *"array-like object"*,
we can borrow Array methods and use them on objects that are array-like.

An **array-like object** is an `object` that has its *keys defined as
non-negative integers*. It is best to *specifically add a length property*.

For example:

	var anArrayLikeObj = {
		0 : "Martin", 
		1 :	78, 
		2 :	67, 
		3 :	["Letta", "Marieta", "Pauline"], 
		length : 4 
	};

Gaze in astonishment as we utilize its *array-like-ness* to its fullest

	// As usual, the first parameter sets the "this" value
    var newArray = Array.prototype.slice.call (anArrayLikeObj, 0);
	console.log (newArray); // ["Martin", 78, 67, Array[3]]
	// notice the 'length' property got skipped because it
	// is *not* a non-negative integer

Note that the `arguments` variable inside any function containing everything
passed to the function as parameters is also an *"array-like object"* upon
which we may call `Array.prototype.slice.call (arguments);` and all the other
`Array` methods, like `indexOf()` and so on. We never made a full *copy* of
the method, we only created some sort of *pointer* to it (conceptually at least).

As expected, if we change the original method, and the method has been set as
a method on another object, the changes are reflected in the borrowed instances.

#### Variable-arity / Variadic functions

* **Think `printf(str, args...)`**
* `Math.max(1,2,3,5,6,7) // => 7` takes any number of arguments.
* We are *not allowed* to pass it a list instead `Math.max([1,2,3,5,6,7])`
* But we *can* `apply()` that list to it `Math.max.apply(null, [1,2,3,5,6,7])`
	* Recall that the first argument sets the `this`, which we don't need
	  in this case.



### .call()

Quite similar to `.apply()`. In fact doing

	instance.method.ca(object2, param1, param2)

does exactly what it would do if we replaced `call()` with `apply()` (see above
for what it does actually do), only we've replaced the `array` containing parameters,
with the actual parameters passed in in a more (one might say) "normal" way.

### .bind()

	$('button').click(user.clickHandler);

At this point, if we use `this` from inside `var user`'s `clickHandler` function,
`this` will be refering to the `<button>` element. But if we instead want it to refer
to the `user` object, we must `bind` it.

So instead if we do

	$('button').click(**user.clickHandler.bind(user)**);

and now it'll manipulate our `user` object as we wanted.

##### .bind() also facilitates currying

	function takes3(a, b, c) {
		var s = a ? 'g' : 'f';
		if (b > 25) return c + s;
		else return "yaya" + s;
	}
	
	var gAboveB = takes3.bind(null, true, 45);
	gAboveB("asdf"); // => "asdfg" (fills in the last parameter from the original function)

event.which
-----------

**Indicates which key was pressed, via its *unicode* value.**

Doesn't seem to do anything for non-alphanumeric-character keys.

#### 4/13/14

### To check what a character key's value is

**How about entering the following in to the interpreter, then going back to
the browser and hitting the key you want the value of?**

    document.onkeypress = function(myEvent) { // note: event needn't be called "e"
        console.log(myEvent.which);
    };

Navigator
---------

**contains information about the visitor's browser.**

[W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_navigator.asp)

Technically, it's the `window.navigator` object, but the `window.`
prefix is not required.

E.g. (from `http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/AudioRecorder/index.html`,
`./Audio Recorder_files/main.js`, function initAudio, [currently]
lines 162-173)

    if (!navigator.getUserMedia)
        navigator.getUserMedia = navigator.webkitGetUserMedia 
                                || navigator.mozGetUserMedia;

Using their example, you can get all sorts of other possibly-useful stuff as well:

    Browser Code-Name:     navigator.appCodeName
    Browser Name:          navigator.appName
    Browser Version:       navigator.appVersion
    Cookies Enabled:       navigator.cookieEnabled
    Platform:              navigator.platform
    User-agent header:     navigator.userAgent
    User-agent language:   navigator.systemLanguage
