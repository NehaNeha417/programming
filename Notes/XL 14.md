# TODOs
## High
### Backend
1. Add a column for Tasks to be complete but not turned in?
    * Is this kludgy? I can't tell.
    * It would definitely work though, and it'd be handy enough to
      justify its existence
2. Add a column for `Tasks` to be `ongoing` (no need to be `complete`)
    * These can then be in a separate table on the `/tasks` page
2. On `http://trracker.herokuapp.com/static/landing`, the **Time per
   Category** chart is visible, but it has **no data**!

### Frontend

1. There should be a button on `/tasks` that makes the table switch
   to showing *complete tasks*
2. A way to have a link to the assignment/reading in question
3. In `/tasks`, sorting by `Duedate`, actually sorts alphabetically
   by day of the week
    * This might help: *http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/2467/need-help-for-sorting-date-with-dd-mm-yyyy-format*
4. When you `edit()` a `Task`
    1. It leaves the `Duedate` field blank
        * It *should* be filled with the *current* `Duedate` value
    2. It defaults the `Category` to the *first* option, rather than
       the *existing* option
    3. Same for `Priority`
5. Do Javascript Validation of forms or at least put the field values
   back when it gets rejected by the validations
6. **Time display issue** -- there is something wrong with the way
   the times saved from the **Datetimepickers** are being displayed
    1. It may be different between the Datetimepickers and the AJAX
       record button (AJAX vrsn may work properly)
    2. **Look into the way the dates are being translated and stored
       into the system**
    3. Check if this is done differently between the localhost one
       and the Heroku-hosted instance
    4. `duedate`s are affected as well (e.g. *http://trracker.herokuapp.com/categories/6*)
    5. The hour-chart is also affected.
        1. I think it's getting raw times from the database
           but this would be easy to verify in the `console`
7. Add **HTML page titles** so that the *back* button reveals where
   it'll take you
8. There should be a page showing a list of the currently *ticking*
   `Tasks`

### Charts

1. A normal line chart [like Bostock's][line chart eg]
    1. Just put it underneath the existing chart --- the transitions
       are not that important right now
2. A line-graph for some kind of *"Score"* that combines the amount of
   time spent doing different things of different priorities
    2. Like the *"Productivity"* rating used to do
 
[line chart eg]: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955

## Medium

### Backend

1. A `robots.txt` file
2. Google Analytics
3. **CSV download and upload**
4. **Dashboard object?** --- Store `User`'s front-page dashboard data in it's
   own `Dashboard` object s.t.
   
        class User
          has_one :dashboard
        end
        class Dashboard
          belongs_to :user
        end
        
5. **`AJAX`ify the `Create` buttons** in `tasks/show.html`
6. A **useful validation** would be to ensure that for `Interval`, \\(start < end\\)
7. **`estTimeRemaining` attribute for `Task`** --- can be `NULL`?
8. **Search bar in navbar** that searches for matching `Tasks` and `Categories`
9. Add **recurring tasks**
10. Add *"clippy"* or whatever that nice file-attachment module is to
   support having a **user-uploaded picture for each *category***
   
### Frontend
1. `Delete` button in `/tasks` should be *red*
2. A way to reorder `subtasks` on a `task`'s page
3. When the page gets skinny, the navbar should actually become that
   mobile-compatible type, because right now it's simply not there at
   all (on the computer) at that point

### Charts

1. **Improve the chart that's already there**
    1. It could even flag when certain assignments were turned in (!)
    2. It'd be kind of cool if it was able to turn into a stacked chart like this [stacked-to-grouped bars chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967), but not really necessary 

3. **A [zoomable pie chart][zpc]** with [labels][pie labels]

1. **A full fledged multi-dimensional plotting and slicing system**
    1. Good-looking tutorials include
        1. [Becoming a Data Scientist][1]
    	  2. [rusty.io][2]
    	  3. [jc-gs.github.io][3]
    	  4. [Square's Crossfilter homepage][4]
    	  5. [D3 Tips & Tricks][5]
    	  6. [bl.ocks.org post][6]

2. **"Sleep-Task-specific" graph**
    1. Just cheat and add a "Sleep"-specific thing that matches on the string name 
        
            = render 'sleep_graph' if @task.name.downcase == "sleep"
    2. Not sure how to pull this off in d3 yet, which is why I'm pushing it down the line
        1. What I want is [vaguely this](http://jsfiddle.net/wRDXt/2/), from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17710371/simple-line-graph-with-dates-in-d3)

5. Really, each `Category` should have one of those *hour charts*

## Low

### Backend

1. Add some simple tests of the most important things/invariants
2. Fill up `db/seeds.rb` with some Ruby code to seed the database with initial data, and run `rake db:seed`, e.g.

        5.times do |i|
          Product.create(name: "Product ##{i}", description: "A product.")
        end        

3. Configure debugging from Intellij

4. To set up the Heroku app to email people, follow the `sendgrid` installation instructions from [Heroku Sendgrid][] and the instructions from the *How to Install and Configure Devise in a Ruby on Rails Application* youtube video

5. Add **goals** to `User`?

6. Add **inspirational quotes** to `User`?

7. Review the youtube video *How to Use Nesting in a Ruby on Rails Application* (*doing that* is certainly over-complicating things, but it may still have useful ideas)

8. Allow user to add a profile picture to their homepage
    * not necessarily a picture of the user
9. **Admin account** that can view open accounts and *administer* them
    11. Seems like the easiest route is just a "Admin" bool field
    12. The thing is that the console is just fine too...
10. To validate across an association, use the following code, but don't do it on both sides because that'd be an infinite loop

        class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_many :otherModel
          validates_associated :otherModel
        end
11. Move TODOs to GitHub Issue Trracker?

# Rough Outline

## Goals

1. Have a way to track how my time is spent
2. "Trick" myself into working harder
3. Not waste time doing useless things

## Motivation

1. Last time I tried this, it was *enormously **successful** as a **motivator***

## Must haves

1. A list of tasks with due dates
2. Recurring tasks
3. Priority levels
4. Input intervals at which a task was worked on

## Imaginings

1. You have a list of categories
    * Which you can add to at will (subtracting sounds dangerous)
2. You click on a category
3. You have a list of tasks or events within that category
    1. The *Life* category might have tasks like Sleeping, Chilling, Partying, Exercising
        * These don't have due dates, but do have time intervals at which they were performed
    2. The *Advanced OSs* category might have tasks like "Assignment 1"
        * Sometimes subtasks are just distracting, but for an item like "Midterm", it *would* be helpful to have subtasks
    3. A Task might have a
        1. due date
        2. priority
        3. expected amount of time left
        4. time spent so far
        5. box for inputting time intervals spent
3. The *Misc Learning* task might have
    * useful youtube videos that I've watched
    * tutorials I read
    * perhaps they could be rated by *how* useful they actually were
4. Some sort of summary page, with
    1. pie charts
    2. trend graphs
    3. colors about good or bad
    4. *calendar heat map!*
5. While a time interval is being recorded, it reminds you to take a break every now and again
6. As a way of entering in a time interval, I'd like it if you could just add the start time as, say `1134 tonight/this morning/last night`, and then instead of entering in the end time, say `time spent = 45`
7. As a way of entering in a lot of data, one could add a CSV file uploader like the one in the youtube video *How to Build a CSV Uploader into a Ruby on Rails Application*. It takes like 3 minutes.
8. Also the *How to Build a CSV Downloader for a Ruby on Rails Application* takes another 3 minutes. Another little nice-to-have.
9. Integrate with FitBit to incorporate its own heatmap, and automatically collect the sleep data?
    1. That actually sounds pretty attractive


## Missing Schema elements

### User

1. (eventually) *has many* **aggregated statistics** (these will probably just be methods)
2. (eventually) *has many* **overarching goals**
3. (eventually) *has many* **inspiring quotes**
4. (eventually) *has an* **icon**


# Vision v2

## Beware

1. **Don't track things that needn't be tracked** --- e.g. food spending: it *just doesn't matter*
2. **Track things I want to hold myself accountable for** --- e.g. wake-up time and time spent exercising
3. **Don't implement things that aren't strictly necessary** until everything necessary is there

## User homepage

It's all a giant Bootstrap 3 Jumbotron

## After it *works*

1. Add a simple github-esque calendar heat map with d3.js, there's examples everywhere

## Over time

1. Do awesome charting with dc.js ("Dimensional Charting in Javascript")
    * I saved a bunch of articles for help figuring out how to use it
    * It's basically exactly what I need, and *certainly* good to know
