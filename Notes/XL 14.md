# TODOs


## High
### Backend

### Frontend

## Medium
### Backend

1. Allow `rspec` tests of authentication-protected areas of the site with **`rspec`**, see the [Devise Wiki][]

5. Add some simple tests of the most important things/invariants

### Frontend

1. Put the task-form's datetimepicker in the center
2. Give that same datetimepicker to the interval form

## Low
### Backend

1. Fill up `db/seeds.rb` with some Ruby code to seed the database with initial data, and run `rake db:seed`, e.g.

        5.times do |i|
          Product.create(name: "Product ##{i}", description: "A product.")
        end

2. To validate across an association, use the following code, but don't do it on both sides because that'd be an infinite loop

        class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_many :otherModel
          validates_associated :otherModel
        end
        
3. The `:through` association is going to be useful

        class User < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_many :categories, dependent: :destroy
          has_many :tasks, through :category, dependent: :destroy
          has_many :subtasks, through :task, dependent: :destroy # ?? just guessing here

4. Configure debugging from Intellij

5. To set up the Heroku app to email people, follow the `sendgrid` installation instructions from [Heroku Sendgrid][] and the instructions from the *How to Install and Configure Devise in a Ruby on Rails Application* youtube video

6. `Users'` homepage should have a list of **upcoming deadlines** (`tasks`)

7. Add **priority levels** for `tasks`, and possibly `categories`

8. Add **expected time remaining** for `tasks`

9. Add **recurring tasks**

10. Add **goals** to `user`

11. Add **inspirational quotes** to `user`

12. Review the youtube video *How to Use Nesting in a Ruby on Rails Application* (*doing that* is certainly over-complicating things, but it may still have useful ideas)

13. Add comprehensive testing

2. Get a Rails `form` to reference another database, following the YouTube video *How to Use Collection Select in a Rails Application*

[Gemfile]: http://www.railstutorial.org/book/updating_and_deleting_users#code-final_gemfile

### Frontend

1. Add an **about page**
2. Add a **home page** (for the site itself, not the user)
3. Make the categories on the user homepage look good
4. Add a profile picture to their homepage
1. *Switch from ERB to Haml*, the conversion can be done [Automatically](http://screencasts.org/episodes/using-haml-with-rails-3)

### Heroku

    git push
    git push heroku
    heroku run rake db:migrate
    
    heroku open
    
    heroku logs
    
    heroku run console    
    >> Rails.env
    => "production"

        
# Rough Outline

## Goals

1. Have a way to track how my time is spent
2. "Trick" myself into working harder
3. Not waste time doing useless things

## Motivation

1. Last time I tried this, it was *enormously **successful** as a **motivator***

## Must haves

1. A list of tasks with due dates
2. Recurring tasks
3. Priority levels
4. Input intervals at which a task was worked on

## Imaginings

1. You have a list of categories
    * Which you can add to at will (subtracting sounds dangerous)
2. You click on a category
3. You have a list of tasks or events within that category
    1. The *Life* category might have tasks like Sleeping, Chilling, Partying, Exercising
        * These don't have due dates, but do have time intervals at which they were performed
    2. The *Advanced OSs* category might have tasks like "Assignment 1"
        * Sometimes subtasks are just distracting, but for an item like "Midterm", it *would* be helpful to have subtasks
    3. A Task might have a
        1. due date
        2. priority
        3. expected amount of time left
        4. time spent so far
        5. box for inputting time intervals spent
3. The *Misc Learning* task might have
    * useful youtube videos that I've watched
    * tutorials I read
    * perhaps they could be rated by *how* useful they actually were
4. Some sort of summary page, with
    1. pie charts
    2. trend graphs
    3. colors about good or bad
    4. *calendar heat map!*
5. While a time interval is being recorded, it reminds you to take a break every now and again
6. As a way of entering in a time interval, I'd like it if you could just add the start time as, say `1134 tonight/this morning/last night`, and then instead of entering in the end time, say `time spent = 45`
7. As a way of entering in a lot of data, one could add a CSV file uploader like the one in the youtube video *How to Build a CSV Uploader into a Ruby on Rails Application*. It takes like 3 minutes.
8. Also the *How to Build a CSV Downloader for a Ruby on Rails Application* takes another 3 minutes. Another little nice-to-have.


## Missing Schema elements

### User

1. (eventually) *has many* **aggregated statistics** (these will probably just be methods)
2. (eventually) *has many* **overarching goals**
3. (eventually) *has many* **inspiring quotes**
4. (eventually) *has an* **icon**


# Vision v2

## Beware

1. **Don't track things that needn't be tracked** --- e.g. food spending: it *just doesn't matter*
2. **Track things I want to hold myself accountable for** --- e.g. wake-up time and time spent exercising
3. **Don't implement things that aren't strictly necessary** until everything necessary is there

## User homepage

It's all a giant Bootstrap 3 Jumbotron

## After it *works*

1. Add a simple github-esque calendar heat map with d3.js, there's examples everywhere

## Over time

1. Do awesome charting with dc.js ("Dimensional Charting in Javascript")
    * I saved a bunch of articles for help figuring out how to use it
    * It's basically exactly what I need, and *certainly* good to know
