I/O Streams
-----------

[Oracle's Java Tuts](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/streams.html)

* Represents an input source *or* an output destination
* Could be disk files, devices, other programs, a network socket, or memory arrays
* Could be any *kind* of data (bytes, primitives, objects, etc.)
* Streams can manipulate and transform the data
* **Input** streams *read* from a source, one item at a time
* **Output** streams *write* to a destination, one item at a time


### Byte Streams

* Byte streams perform I/O of 8-bit bytes
* All byte stream classes descend from `InputStream` and `OutputStream`
* E.g. `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`, which in particular `read()`s/`write()`s from files
	* Otw they act much the same as any other byte stream
* Only use byte streams when there is no higher-level abstraction of your use-case available
	* But note that those higher-level abstractions are *built* on byte streams


### Character Streams

* Uses Unicode conventions
* All character stream classes descend from `Reader` and `Writer`
* For file I/O, we have `FileReader` and `FileWriter`


### Buffered Streams

* The aforementioned I/O classes use *unbuffered I/O* -- where each read/write is
  handled directly by the underlying OS
    * This can be inefficient, so we use *buffered I/O* streams
* **Buffered I/O streams read data from a memory area known as a *buffer*; the native
  input API is called only when the buffer is empty**
    * Writing data is analogously done to a buffer, with the OS only writing-out
      when the buffer is full
* One can **convert an unbuffered into a buffered stream by passing the unbuffered stream
  object into the constructor for a buffered stream class**
  
		inputStream = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt"));
		
	* This is that thing you've seen oh-so-many times
* *Flushing* the buffer is when you write out non-full buffer (use `flush()`)

### Scanners

	s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt")));

* A `Scanner` breaks input into *tokens*
* By default it uses whitespace to separate tokens
* To change it to `comma with optional following whitespace`, use:

		s.useDelimiter(",\\s*");
		
### Data streams

Support I/O of primitive data types

### Object streams

* Support I/O of objects
* Objects that support serialization implement `Serializable`

E.g.

	out.writeObject(obj);
	Object obj = in.readObject();
	
	
GSON
----

[On Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)

* A library that can convert Java Objects into their JSON representation, and back.
* Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you
  do not have source-code of.
* Provides simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa

Java concurrency
================

**5/12/14**

Ref:
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_concurrency)

* The programmer must ensure read and write access to objects is properly coordinated
  (or "synchronized") between threads.
* Thread synchronization ensures that objects are modified by only one thread at a time
* And that threads are prevented from accessing partially updated objects during
  modification by another thread.
* The Java language has built-in constructs to support this coordination.
* Multiple processes can only be realized with multiple JVMs, so we really just care
  about *multi*-***threaded*** programming
  
#### Thread objects

* **Threads share the process's resources, including memory** and open files.
* This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.
* Every application has at least one thread called the `main thread`.
* The `main thread` has the ability to create additional threads from the
  `Runnable` or `Callable` object
* Each thread can be scheduled on a different CPU core
* Every JVM implementation can map Java threads to native OS threads in a different way
* Each thread is associated with an instance of the `class Thread`

##### Two ways to start a thread

###### Provide a Runnable object

	public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable {
	   public void run() {
	       System.out.println("Hello from thread!");
	   }
	   public static void main(String[] args) {
	       (new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start();
	   }
	}

###### Subclass Thread

	public class HelloThread extends Thread {
	   public void run() {
	       System.out.println("Hello from thread!");
	   }
	   public static void main(String[] args) {
	       (new HelloThread()).start();
	   }
	}

#### Thread basics

* Use `Thread.interrupt()` to tell a thread to stop what it is doing and do something else.
* Wait for the completion of another thread with `Thread.join()`
* To synchronize threads, Java uses **monitors**, a mechanism allowing only one thread
  at a time to execute a region of code protected by the monitor
  
##### Cache coherence:

* After we exit a synchronized block, we release the monitor
* This flushes the cache to main memory, making writes made by this thread visible to other threads.
* So now, before we can enter a synchronized block, we acquire the monitor, invalidating the
  local processor cache, so that variables will be reloaded from main memory, so are now able
  to see all of the writes made by the previous release.


### Java Memory Model

Ref:
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Memory_Model)

* On modern platforms, code is frequently reordered by the compiler, the processor and
  the memory subsystem to achieve maximum performance.
* On multiprocessor architectures, individual processors may have their own local caches that
  are out of sync with main memory.
* It is generally undesirable to require threads to remain perfectly in sync with one
  another because this would be too costly from a performance point of view.
* This means that at any given time, different threads may see different values for the
  same shared data.
* **The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines** the allowable behavior of multithreaded
  programs, and therefore describes **when such reorderings are possible**.
* It places execution-time constraints on the relationship between threads and main
  memory in order to achieve consistent and reliable Java applications.
* By doing this, it makes it possible to reason about code execution in a multithreaded
  environment, even in the face of optimizations performed by the dynamic compiler, the
  processor(s) and the caches.
* The *Java Language Specification* requires a *Java Virtual Machine* to observe
  `within-thread` `as-if-serial` semantics.
* The major caveat of this is that `as-if-serial` semantics do *not* prevent different threads
  from having different views of the data.
* Everything that happens before the release of a lock will be seen to be ordered before
  and visible to everything that happens after a subsequent acquisition of that same lock.


### Synchronized

Ref:

* [SO-1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/442564/avoid-synchronizedthis-in-java)
* [SO-2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/574240/synchronized-block-vs-synchronized-method)
* [SO-3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085709/what-does-synchronized-mean)

Here is a quote from Sun:

> Synchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and
> memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads
> or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods.


#### Block vs Method

Synchronized block

	public void blah() {
	  synchronized (this) {
	    // do stuff
	  }
	}

is semantically equivalent to synchronized method

	public synchronized void blah() {
	  // do stuff
	}

* The only real difference is that a synchronized block can choose which object
  it synchronizes on.
* A `synchronized` method can only use `this`
	* Or the corresponding `class` instance for a synchronized `static` class method


#### synchronized(this) block

* Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that
  provides the intrinsic lock

#### synchronized method

Two Effects:

1. When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other
   threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend
   execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
2. When a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before
   relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same
   object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to
   all threads. (not sure what this means)
   
Other notes:

* Constructors cannot be synchronized â€” using the synchronized keyword with a
  constructor is a syntax error. Synchronizing constructors doesn't make sense,
  because only the thread that creates an object should have access to it while
  it is being constructed.

#### Other

* Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it
	* This is what the implementation of `synchronized` relies upon to use the
	  `monitor` synchronization pattern
* Note that of course we *could* also use an "explicit lock" such as
  `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`, which provides the same implications
  for memory behavior.
  

### Volatile Fields

* Guarantees that every thread accessing a volatile field will read its current value
  before continuing, instead of (potentially) using a cached value.
* However, there is no guarantee about the relative ordering of volatile reads and
  writes with regular reads and writes, meaning that it's generally not a useful
  threading construct.
* Volatile reads and writes establish a happens-before relationship, much like acquiring
  and releasing a mutex.
	* This relationship is simply a guarantee that memory writes by one specific statement
	  are visible to another specific statement.


Inheritance
===========

### Private fields

**5/9/14**

* `private` fields are not inherited by subclasses.
* Both `protected` *and* `public` fields *are* inherited by subclasses,
  *no matter* whether they are in the same `package`.
* Instances of subclasses of course *do **contain*** the private fields
  of their superclasses, they just have no access to them.
  
### Useful chart

**5/9/14**

| Modifier    | Class | Package | Subclass | World|
|:-----------:|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|:----:|
| public      |   âœ”   |    âœ”    |    âœ”     |   âœ”  |
| protected   |   âœ”   |    âœ”    |    âœ”     |   âœ˜  |
| no modifier |   âœ”   |    âœ”    |    âœ˜     |   âœ˜  |
| private     |   âœ”   |    âœ˜    |    âœ˜     |   âœ˜  |


#### Notes on chart

`no modifier` is even stricter than `protected`, and what it *doesn't*
allow is `subclass` access, even though it retains `package` access. I
find this counterintuitive, personally.

### instanceof

**5/9/14**

`child instanceof Parent` will return **`true`**


### The question mark wildcard type

**5/9/14**

[SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3009745/what-does-the-question-mark-in-java-generics-type-parameter-mean)

E.g.

	List<? extends HasWord> wordList = toke.tokenize();
	
This means we'll allow anything that extends `HasWord`, plus `null`, but we don't
care to name the type because we'll just be calling methods that are specified by
`HasWord`.


Other things one simply must know about Java
======================================

Equals and HashCode
-------------------

[SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27581)

### Equals

Must be 

* reflexive -- `a.equals(a) == true`
* symmetric -- `a.equals(b) iff b.equals(a)`
* transitive -- `a.equals(b) && b.equals(c) => a.equals(c)`
* consistent  -- always returns the same value for the same [unchanged] object

If you *don't* `@Override public boolean equals(Object o){}`, each instance is
*equal only to itself*. If this is what you want: *don't override* `equals` (e.g. `Thread`).


### Hash Code

Rules

* `a.equals(b) => a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()`


Comparable vs. Comparator
-------------------------

Refs:
[SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4108604),
[digizol](http://www.digizol.com/2008/07/java-sorting-comparator-vs-comparable.html)

* Both are **`interfaces`** you can implement
* **Comparable says "I can compare *myself* with another object"**
* **Comparator says "I can compare two *other* objects with each other"**
* **Use `comparable` if it's your class, otw use `comparator`**


### Comparable

* **Says "I can compare *myself* with another object"**
* Allows you to define comparison logic for *your own* types.

#### Signature
  
	java.lang.Comparable: int compareTo(Object o1) {
		
		case this > o2 => x > 0;
		case this = o2 => x = 0;
		case this < o2 => x < 0;
	
	}
	
#### How to declare

	public class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {
	
		public int compareTo(MyClass o) {
			return this.field - o.field;
		}
	
	}

#### How to use

Simply declare it as in the "How to declare" section above.

### Comparator

* **Says "I can compare two *other* objects with each other"**
* Allows *you* to define comparison logic for types you don't control.
* E.g. you could write a new way to compare strings by `extending
  Comparator`.

#### Signature
  
	java.lang.Comparator: int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
		
		case o1 > o2 => x > 0;
		case o1 = o2 => x = 0;
		case o1 < o2 => x < 0;
	
	}

#### How to declare

	public class MyClassSortByField implements Comparator<MyClass> {
	
		public int compare(MyClass o1, MyClass o2) {
			o1.getField().compareTo(o2.getField());
		}
	
	}
	
#### How to use

Make a method like this


		public static Comparator<Fruit> FruitNameComparator 
                          = new Comparator<Fruit>() {
 
		    public int compare(Fruit fruit1, Fruit fruit2) {
		
		      String fruitName1 = fruit1.getFruitName().toUpperCase();
		      String fruitName2 = fruit2.getFruitName().toUpperCase();
		
		      //ascending order
		      return fruitName1.compareTo(fruitName2);
		
		      //descending order
		      //return fruitName2.compareTo(fruitName1);
		    }
 
		};
		
And then do this
	
	import java.util.Arrays;
	
	Fruit[] fruits = new Fruit[4];
 
	Fruit pineappale = new Fruit("Pineapple", "Pineapple description",70); 
	Fruit apple = new Fruit("Apple", "Apple description",100); 
	Fruit orange = new Fruit("Orange", "Orange description",80); 
	Fruit banana = new Fruit("Banana", "Banana description",90); 

	fruits[0] = pineappale;
	fruits[1] = apple;
	fruits[2] = orange;
	fruits[3] = banana;

	Arrays.sort(fruits); // ClassCastException
	
	Arrays.sort(fruits, Fruit.FruitNameComparator);  // works
