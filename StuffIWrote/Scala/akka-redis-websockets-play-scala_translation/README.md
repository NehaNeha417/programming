This is a simple Chat Room Play! 2.2 app, based on/copied from
[jsimone's `play-websockets-chat-sample`](https://github.com/jsimone/play-websockets-chat-sample),
which is based on the one from the [playframework github](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/tree/master/samples/scala/websocket-chat),
which I also took hints from.

jsimone's was written in Java, and this one will be in Scala.
