## TODO

1. use `nodemon` -- add it to the `npm start` task I guess
1. rename blogs to nodes
1. enable "hinging" nodes on each other
    * hinging one node onto another should also create both parent
      and child links
1. indent nodes to show the tree structure
1. switch rendering engine from `swig` to `jade`
    * convert the view files
    * switch the directive in `render.js`
