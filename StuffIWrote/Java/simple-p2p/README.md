# Simple P2P

This project is about making the simplest possible P2P network and *learning
as I go.*  Currently, I don't really know much about file sharing or P2P.  I
will be using a tracker-file, which is apparently the way BitTorrent tracks
files.

## New Route

I'm going back to having the Tracker simply maintain a list of seeders, rather
than seeders-by-chunk.  Then (eventually) the Client will have to query
Seeders about which chunks are available, but for now Seeders will have the
whole file.

## Fun-looking next-steps

* Performance experiments
    * Find the bottlenecks in different scenarios
        * When is the tracker-server the bottleneck?
    * TCP vs UDP
* **DHT** -- note that this would *replace* the *"tracker"* system
    * BitTorrent uses *Mainline DHT*
        * [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT)
        * [Protocol spec draft](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html)
    * Which is based on *Kademlia* (Mazi√©res!)
        * [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)
        * [Research article](http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/109.pdf)
* Enhance a `P2PFile` to allow
    * a directory rather than just a file
    * download using multiple trackers (field `List<Tracker>` instead of
      `Tracker`)
    * Cryptographic hash values for verifying file integrity
* Swappable algorithms, optimizations
* Secure connection (SSL?), secure transfer (hashed chunks?), encrypted file
  chunks ("pieces")
* Java has an API for *"watching"* a directory for changes, use that.

## Glossary Mapping

Wikipedia maintains a nice [BitTorrent glossary][bt gloss], from which I
understand that

| **My Name**   | **BitTorrent Name**               |
| ------------: | :-------------------------------- |
| `Tracker`     | fills both roles tracker & index  |
| file chunk    | piece                             |
| `P2PFile`     | torrent                           |

## The Basic Layout

### Tracker

* Has lists of peers seeding and leeching for each file
    * In the , the node providing this
      service is called an "index"
* In the first, simplest iteration, it will just direct you to the seeders and
  initiate a download from them
    * E.g. 1/2 from one guy 1/2 from the other
* The `DHT` can come later, let's just get the files *distributed* first

### Peer

* Has a list of files
* Can provide or obtain files from other peers

## Order of Implementation

1. `Peer` creates a `FileGroup` for a `P2PFile` on the `Tracker`
2. `Peer` requests a *listing* of all files available on the `Tracker`
3. `Peer` downloads a file from a *single* seeder
4. `Peer` downloads a file from *two* seeders
5. Using my two laptops and 2+ school computers, time-test it against `rsync`
